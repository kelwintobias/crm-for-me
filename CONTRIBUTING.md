# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

- Open an issue to propose changes or report bugs.
- Create a branch from `main` and open a pull request with a clear description.
- Follow existing code style and add tests where appropriate.
- CI (GitHub Actions) runs on push/PR — make sure checks pass.

For minor changes you can open a small PR and request a review.
